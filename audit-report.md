# User Creation Flow Audit Report

## Executive Summary
This audit examines the user creation process in the SmartCut application to ensure all relevant tables are properly populated when a new user registers.

## Tables That Should Be Populated During User Creation

### 1. Core User Tables
- **auth.users** - Supabase authentication table (managed by Supabase)
- **public.users** - Application user data
- **public.profiles** - User profile information
- **public.subscriptions** - User subscription data

### 2. Stripe Integration Tables
- **stripe_customers** - Links users to Stripe customers
- **stripe_subscriptions** - Tracks subscription status

### 3. Notification Tables
- **user_notifications** - Created when notifications exist (not during user creation)

## Current Status Analysis

### ✅ Working Tables
1. **auth.users** - Properly managed by Supabase Auth
2. **public.profiles** - Being created by trigger
3. **public.subscriptions** - Being created by trigger

### ❌ Problematic Tables
1. **public.users** - NOT being populated consistently
2. **stripe_customers** - Temporary records created but not updated
3. **stripe_subscriptions** - Temporary records created but not updated

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: public.users Table Not Populated
- The trigger function `handle_new_user()` creates users table records
- However, there may be timing issues or constraint violations
- Error logging shows inconsistent execution

### Issue 2: Stripe Integration Issues
- Temporary Stripe records are created but never updated to real Stripe IDs
- The Edge Function `create-stripe-customer` should update these records
- There's a disconnect between trigger creation and Edge Function updates

## Recommended Fixes

### 1. Simplify User Creation Trigger
- Remove Stripe operations from the trigger
- Focus only on essential local database records
- Let Edge Functions handle Stripe integration separately

### 2. Improve Error Handling
- Add better transaction management
- Implement retry mechanisms
- Enhanced logging for debugging

### 3. Fix Stripe Integration Flow
- Update Edge Function to properly replace temporary records
- Add proper error handling for Stripe API calls
- Implement fallback mechanisms
